    "For stock price prediction, our real prediction goal is daily return. The reasons are as follows:\n",
    "1. The rate of return is stable: Fluctuations in stock prices may be affected by a variety of factors, including market noise, emotions, and macroeconomics.\n",

    "2. Relatively stable return distribution: The distribution of return is relatively stable and more consistent with statistical assumptions, making predictions based on statistical models more reliable.\n",
